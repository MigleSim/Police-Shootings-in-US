# Police Brutality in United States Data Analysis


#### -- Project Status: In Progress

## Project Intro/Objective

The purpose of this project is to analyze the factors that impact people being shot by police and provide the main priorities for further improvements. 

Conclusions:

- Data needed small improvements, overall data quality is good, 
- Most victims were males,
- People with mental illness are shot more often than those are not, based on their population. 
- In more than 60% cases victims were attacked first, police officers were threatened, 
- More than 60% victims were not fleeing. 
- 89% percent cases did not have body camera data.
- By counts white race are shot most often, but when taken in account the counts for other races, black race has the biggest number of victims. 
- Out of 2142 cases 1200 were armed with a gun. 

- The biggest victims count is in California, Texas and Florida however it is important to note that these states are most populated. 
- Taken into account population, the biggest victims count per 100,000 people are in New Mexico, Oklahoma, Alaska and Washington DC. 

- I would suggest making improvements from those states. Albuquerque, Oklahoma City, Anchorage, Fairbanks and Washington DC are the cities that should looked at first. 
- Taken into account populations of races, for New Mexico hispanic people are shot the most, Oklahoma - black people, Alaska - native american. Important to note that in Washington DC only black people were shot. 

The most important things to take a look at are how to improve body cameras footage, gun control and mental illness awareness.
